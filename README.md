----------------------------------------

🎓I have studied and graduated in economics and I have worked for 10 years in retail but at a certain point, I looked in the mirror, I looked at my work experience, I looked at what the future might hold for me and I decided that would not be my path.

🌱 I am studying to learn as many skills as possible in Data Analysis and I'm working on my personal portfolio which will be online soon. 

➡ Here you'll mostly find Python and SQL code
